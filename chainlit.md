# AI Assistant for the **Energy Technology List (ETL)** 


Designed by **Assistant Engineering** [https://assistant.engineering](https://assistant.engineering), this chatbot demonstrates the use of custom knowledge sources in conjunction with a Large Language Model (LLM).

**How It Works**
We start by calling the ETL's Application Programming Interface (API) to collect their green energy product list. We vectorise this data and store it in a vector database.  

Then we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect that database to the LLM as a specialised knowledge source. We also provide some custom instructions and tuning to the LLM.

The result is a natural language interface that makes it easy to engage with and inquire about the 8,000 sustainable energy products in the ETL list.  We can do this sort of thing with many, many data sources. ðŸš€ðŸ¤–

**About The ETL**
[https://etl.energysecurity.gov.uk](https://etl.energysecurity.gov.uk)
The Energy Technology List (ETL) is a UK government project aimed at helping businesses and the public sector to make greener energy choices. It's free to use and backed by the Government's Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

The list functions as an easy-to-use procurement tool for energy managers, procurement professionals, facilities managers and a wide variety of other professions and organisations. It is recognised in various sustainability assessment processes including BREEAM and SKA rating.
