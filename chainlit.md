# About the ETL AI Assistant 

Designed by [**Assistant Engineering**](https://assistant.engineering), this Assistant uses the Chainlit framework to demonstrate a custom knowledge source being combined with a Large Language Model (LLM) to tailor the Assistant to a particular topic.

&nbsp;
**How It Works**:
We start by calling the ETL's Application Programming Interface (API) to collect their green energy product list. We vectorise this data and store it in a Pinecone vector database.  

Then we use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to connect that database to the LLM as a specialised knowledge source. We also provide some custom instructions and tuning prompts for the LLM.

The result is a natural language interface that makes it easy to engage with the 8,000 sustainable energy products in the ETL list.  We can do this sort of thing with many, many data sources. Contact us at [team@assistant.engineering](mailto:team@assistant.engineering) to learn more. ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
